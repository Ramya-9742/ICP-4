This code is about showing how performance changing on various factors
1.Convolutional input layer, 32 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Dropout layer at 20%. • Convolutional layer, 32 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Max Pool layer with size 2×2. • Convolutional layer, 64 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Dropout layer at 20%. • Convolutional layer, 64 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Max Pool layer with size 2×2. • Convolutional layer, 128 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Dropout layer at 20%. • Convolutional layer,128 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Max Pool layer with size 2×2. • Flatten layer. • Dropout layer at 20%. • Fully connected layer with 1024 units and a rectifier activation function. • Dropout layer at 20%. • Fully connected layer with 512 units and a rectifier activation function. • Dropout layer at 20%. • Fully connected output layer with 10 units and a Softmax activation function 
2. Predicting the first 4 images of the test data using the above model. Then, comparing with the actual label for those 4 images to check whether or not the model has predicted correctly.
3. Visualizing Loss and Accuracy using the history object
